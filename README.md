# SOEN342-Project:
Project for the SOEN342 course at Concordia University Canada for the Fall 2024 semester

## Description
The project is a system designed to support organizations in offering group or private lessons (e.g., yoga, swimming) in various rented or owned spaces across multiple locations. It allows clients to browse and book available lessons, while instructors can register, view and take on lesson offerings. The system manages lesson scheduling, instructor assignments and client booking. For underage clients, bookings are handled by a legal guardian. An administrator oversees the system, managing offerings and user accounts.
